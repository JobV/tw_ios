## Instructions

- `pod install` before starting to work
- start working from `.workspace`, rather than `.xcodeproj`.

## REST API

The rest api uses restkit pod to consume and populate the twapi.

Rest API Folder has two folders.

* Controller - Object related controllers (Location, User, etc.)
* Classes - Objects to which controllers map rest requests and responses
